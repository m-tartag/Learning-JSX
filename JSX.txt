JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript. It was written to be used with React. JSX come looks a lot like HTML.

If a JavaScript file contains JSX code, then that file will have to be compiled.

Before the file reaches a web browser —> a JSX compiler will translate any JSX into regular JS

A basic unit of JSX is called an element.

	Ex:  <h1>Hello World</h1>

This looks just like HTML! The only difference is that you would find this in a JavaScript file, not an HTML file.

JSX elements are treated as JavaScript EXPRESSIONS.  They can go anywhere that JavaScript expressions can go.

That means that a JSX element can be saved in a variable passed to a function, store in an object or array.. you name it.

Here’s an example of a JSX element being saved in a variable: 

ex:   const navBar = <nav>I am a nav bar</nav>

Here’s an example of several JSX elements being stood in an object: 

const myTeam = {
  center: <li>Benzo Walli</li>,
  powerForward: <li>Rasha Loa</li>,
  smallForward: <li>Tayshaun Dasmoto</li>,
  shootingGuard: <li>Colmar Cumberbatch</li>,
  pointGuard: <li>Femi Billon</li>
};

JSX elements can have ATTRIBUTES just like HTML elements can. 

A JSX attribute is written using HTML-like syntax: a name, followed by an equals sign, followed by a value. The value should be wrapped in quotes, like this:

		My-attribute-name=“my-attribute-value”

	Ex:  <a href="http://www.example.com">Welcome to the Web</a>;

		const title = <h1 id="title">Introduction to React.js: Part I</h1>; 

	A single JSX element can have many attributes, just like in HTML:

		const panda = <img src="images/panda.jpg" alt="panda" 					width="500px" height="500px" />;
